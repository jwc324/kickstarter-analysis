# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Module 1: Excel Work
Description: Louise is looking to start a kickstarter for her play and needs to know more about typical kickstarter practices with regards to her show and raising $12,000.
## Data Source and Procedures
Data Source: Provided dataset containing kickstarter campaigns between June 2014 - Sept 2016
1. Data organized and formatted for ease of reference. (See tab 'Edited'.)
2. Additional columns, 'Percentage Funded' and ''Average Donation' were created in the data set
## Findings
1. Kickstarters for plays in the US have a 61% success rate. However, Louise's goal of $12k is considered to be a statistical outlier as it is much higher than the typical kickstarter goal for a US play.

2. The average goal of successful campaigns is $5,049 and of failed campaigns is $10,554. Louise's goal exceeds the average failed campaign goal.
3. Note: The data set had only 2015-6 as full years' data. Using 2015-6 as a directional guide, we can see that there is seasonality to the success of kickstarters. The Fall/Winter season seems to be when backers are most likely to donate more money (>$80), with a peak in May as well.

4. Using 2015-6 as an indicator, the rate of success in reaching the goal is not affected by seasonality. Despite a greater number of kickstarters for plays in months Mar-July, the success rate is linked more closely to the goal of the campaign being between $2k-6k.
## Actions
1. Louise needs to adjust the goal of her campaign. She is unlikely to raise $12k at once for her play. Consider multiple rounds of fundraising, or adjusting the overall goal to be lesser.
2. Aim for the average donation per backer to be around $81. (This is the average donation for all successful plays in the US.)
3. Take advantage of the fall/winter season, when backers seem to be more amenable to backing plays.
